"""Test fixtures.

DB-touching tests use the dev Postgres (the one docker compose brings up).
Each test runs inside a transaction that is rolled back at teardown so
in-test writes don't persist. We also TRUNCATE the small set of tables
that the queue/songs API reads at fixture setup — without this, rows left
over from interactive dev (or earlier test runs that committed outside
the fixture) leak into list/count assertions. The whole arrangement can
be swapped for testcontainers in a later polish phase.

Storage: production runs `STORAGE_BACKEND=s3` for DO Spaces. Tests force
the local backend rooted at a per-session tmpdir so we don't accidentally
talk to (or rely on network access to) DO Spaces during pytest.
