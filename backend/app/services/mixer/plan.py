"""Hand-built mix-plan generator — the deterministic fallback for the LLM.

Takes two AnalysisBundles and emits a list of tool-call dicts matching
the spec's Mix Plan Schema. Pure function; no I/O, no DB.

Strategy:
1. Seam in A = last section start, clamped to "no more than 16 bars
   before A.duration", snapped to nearest downbeat ≥ that point.
2. Seam in B = first downbeat ≥ end of B's first section (skip silent
   intros / count-ins).
3. duration_bars = min(16, available outro / bar, available stretched
   intro / bar), floored at 4 with a warning when shorter.

Phase 7 explicitly does NOT pitch-shift. pyrubberband artifacts at
shifts > 2 semitones can sound worse than the harmonic dissonance
they're trying to fix, and small shifts are subtle enough that most
listeners won't notice the mismatch. Phase 9's LLM has the
`pitch_shift` and `temporary_pitch_shift` tools available and can
decide per-pair whether to use them; the hand-built generator stays
neutral and leaves keys as-is.

`compute_pitch_shift` stays in the module as a public utility so
Phase 9 (and anything else that wants to reason about smallest-shift
targets) doesn't have to duplicate the key-parsing logic.
