"""The transition *decision* — planner v2's LLM output contract.

Instead of emitting raw tool calls with hand-computed timestamps (v1),
the model emits this small, discrete decision: which pre-validated seam
candidates to use, which archetype, and a few bounded knobs. The
deterministic expander in `archetypes.py` turns it into an exact,
invariant-satisfying tool-call list.

Pydantic does the heavy lifting on validation, so a malformed model
response raises a clean ValidationError (→ repair / fallback) instead
of producing a broken render.
