# --group worker: pulls torch + demucs + torchaudio (the optional dep
# group defined in pyproject.toml). The dockerized backend skips this
# group entirely so its image stays small; only the native worker needs
# the ML stack.
#
# --pool=threads --concurrency=4: lets the worker run up to 4 tasks
# concurrently in OS threads. Safe now that heavy ML runs on Modal —
# the local worker mostly orchestrates I/O (yt-dlp download, S3
# transfers, blocking modal.Function.remote() calls), all of which
# release the GIL or are network-bound. We avoid --pool=prefork
# specifically because torch + MPS crashes (SIGABRT) under fork on
# macOS; threads sidestep that since they share the parent's memory.
# Bump --concurrency higher only if you want more songs in-flight than
# Modal's free tier wants to spin up at once (each parallel separation
# is its own GPU container).
